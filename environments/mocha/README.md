# Mocha

These configuration files are suitable to lint Mocha test files.

## Configurations

### @strv/javascript/environments/mocha/recommended

Use this ruleset to configure ESLint to lint your Mocha test files. Mocha test files are by default identified by `*.test.*` or `*.spec.*` filenames or by being in the _test/_ directory in your project root.

> ⚠️ You can use this environment ruleset in combination with any of the existing environment rulesets. Just make sure this one comes in as the last one.
